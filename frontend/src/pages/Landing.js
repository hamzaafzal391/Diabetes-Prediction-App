        <p className="text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body converts food into energy.
          It results in elevated blood glucose levels, which can damage the heart, kidneys, nerves, and eyes over time.
          Many people with diabetes are unaware of their risk until complications arise.
          <br /><br />
          Thatâ€™s why early detection is crucial. By evaluating a few health indicators like glucose levels,
          blood pressure, insulin, and BMI, this tool provides you with an instant risk assessment.
          Use this insight to take control of your health today â€” because prevention starts with awareness.
